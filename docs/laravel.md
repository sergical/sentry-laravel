# Laravel

- Easy setup to get started
- Good options in the wizzard
- Positively surprised with auth being baked into the intial setup (however Laravel or WorkOS only options - seems limiting especially if you don't know other options exist)
- Lots of upsells to Herd but unclear what I am missing out on by doing manual setup.
- Weird that it didn't initialize an empty git repo even though it has .github folders for linting and tests and .gitignore files but idk maybe npx stuff works differently than `laravel`
- Laravel calls the react folder `js` but it's all TypeScript files lol
- Laravel cloud wants my CC on sandbox environment? annoying
